# pending-promise agent instructions

Canonical instructions for this independent repository and its descendants. Read the local README and relevant guides before changing code. This utility is authored with Beyond and must preserve its public package and module boundaries.

The class is a native Promise subclass with `resolve` and `reject` on the instance and nothing else: no timeout, reset, settled flag, observer or `value` member. Keep it that small; [validation](docs/validation.md) maps each contract to its test.

- Preserve the selected branch, existing changes and public identifiers. Do not commit, push, reset, deploy or publish without explicit authorization.
- Use English for first-party documentation, comments and explanatory text. Preserve functional strings and generated/vendor content.
- Keep repository content portable: never write a developer's checkout, home, temporary-toolchain or agent-runtime path into documentation, instructions, code, fixtures or versioned evidence. Use repository-relative paths, documented variables or neutral placeholders.
- Keep documentation autonomous: relative links stay inside this repository; external packages are described as contracts with optional references.
- Preserve the existing module/object programming structure. Internal files are not automatically public modules. Keep bare public imports intact.
- Distinguish source behavior, known defects, proposed changes and executed validation. Documentation work does not authorize implementation changes, dependency installations or service startup.
- Validate links, anchors and formatting for documentation edits. Run tests appropriate to actual code changes only.
- Test every change to a public module in `tests/`, following the Beyond testing conventions in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md#conventions): Node's own test runner, one process per file; imports by the public specifier a consumer uses, never a source file; readiness, events and answers awaited rather than time, with the runner's timeout bounding every wait; whatever a test creates removed with `t.after`, on failure as well; no fixed ports or directories; outcomes asserted, error and recovery paths included. Record the contract each test establishes in [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md).
- Keep the `package-lock.json` of each manifest versioned and update it in the same change as its manifest (`npm install --package-lock-only`); `node_modules` stays ignored.
- Follow the [coding standards](docs/coding-standards.md); they are binding for new and modified code. Source files target 300 lines or fewer and must not exceed 400. Model each responsibility as a class that owns `#private` state and exposes simply named members, composed from collaborating objects. Avoid compound names in methods, properties, variables and parameters by giving the responsibility its own object: `client.register()`, not `registerClient()`. Compound names remain allowed in class definitions. Preserve public contracts, and do not rewrite untouched files only to comply.

Documentation follows [the local documentation standards](docs/AGENTS.md).

The coordinated working branch is `feature/next`. Its base preserves the selected TypeScript implementation; do not switch back to historical source branches for ordinary work.
